# 🎉 Birthday Tracker — Antalpha JK Ventures

This is one of my **first personal web development projects**, built when I first became interested in programming. The purpose of the site is simple: **to track the birthdays of all my colleagues** at Antalpha JK Ventures.

>  I created this project while learning web development through the [W3Schools Bootcamp](https://www.w3schools.com/). It was a fun and meaningful way to practice HTML, CSS, and responsive design fundamentals.
